# Implementations of Classification Algorithms

The repository demonstrates the application of different Machine Learning tools on a real world classification problem. The data being used the [Bank Marketing Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing) from the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php).

The tools that were applied to the data are
* [Weka (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis)](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/index.html)
* [Weka](WEKA)
* [KNIME](KNIME)
* [R](https://github.com/ml4economics/notebooks-r)
* [Python with scikit-learn](https://github.com/ml4economics/notebooks-python)
* [GNU Octave](https://github.com/ml4economics/notebooks-octave)

## Jupyter Notebooks
Example implementations for several algorithms are available as [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) on [Binder](https://mybinder.org).
To run the notebooks locally check out the instructions for [running Jupyter notebooks locally](JupyterNotebooks.md).
