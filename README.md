# Implementations of Classification Algorithms

Here are the tools being used
* [KNIME](KNIME)
* [Weka (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis)](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/index.html)
* [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
* [Python with scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org)
* [GNU Octave](Octave)

## Jupyter Notebooks
Example implementations for several algorithms are available as [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) on [Binder](mybinder.org).
To run the notebooks locally check out the instructions for [running Jupyter notebooks locally](JupyterNotebooks.md).
